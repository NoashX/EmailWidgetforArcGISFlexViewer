==============================

Custom Email Widget for ArcGIS Viewer for Flex 3.3

This file includes the config-all.xml and the config.xml. These files need to be modified to show the Email Widget icon. 
Simply copy and paste the relevant parts if you have already customized your viewer. If you are just starting up, it is
ok to copy and paste these files into your relevant directory.

The Email folder needs to be placed here: "src\widgets\Email" and then the project must be built.

Also included is a suggested image for the Email Widget icon, but please use whatever pleases you.
